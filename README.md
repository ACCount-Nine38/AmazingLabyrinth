# About the Project
Amazing Labyrinth is a maze game that can be played with up to 4 players. 
The host of the game can select each player as an AI of 3 levels(simple AI, strong AI, insane AI) or just a regular human player.
Each player have a randomly assigned deck with 5 random cards(treasures). The player who finds all the treasures first wins.
During each turn, the current player can shift tiles around the map to get closer to a treasure, or block others to prevent them from winning.
